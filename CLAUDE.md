# AGENT-11 (MCP-11) Development Project

**Repository**: https://github.com/TheWayWithin/mcp-11

## Project Overview
AGENT-11 is a revolutionary multi-agent system that transforms Claude Code into a fully-connected AI workspace through intelligent MCP orchestration. The system enables "one command, any use case, zero complexity" for developers.

## Development Commands

### Testing & Quality Assurance
```bash
# Run tests (when implemented)
npm test

# Run linting (when implemented)
npm run lint

# Run type checking (when implemented)
npm run typecheck
```

### MCP Management
```bash
# Install all configured MCPs
npm run mcp:install

# Test MCP connectivity
npm run mcp:test

# Reset MCP configuration
npm run mcp:reset
```

## Phase 1 Development Focus

### Essential MCPs (Priority 1)
- **Git MCP**: Repository management and automation
- **Context7 MCP**: Intelligent context management
- **Playwright MCP**: Comprehensive testing automation
- **Firecrawl MCP**: Research and content analysis

### Foundation MCPs (Priority 2)
- **Filesystem MCP**: Local file operations
- **GitHub MCP**: Repository integration
- **Memory MCP**: Persistent context storage

### Deployment MCPs (Priority 3)
- **Supabase MCP**: Database and backend services
- **Railway MCP**: Backend deployment
- **Figma MCP**: Design integration

## Development Principles

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Each specialized agent (@developer, @tester, @strategist) has clear responsibilities
2. **Progressive Installation**: Start with core MCPs, then add advanced features
3. **95% Success Rate**: Target near-perfect installation success
4. **5-Minute Setup**: Complete MCP environment in under 5 minutes

## Current Development Phase
**Phase 1: Foundation MVP (Weeks 1-4)**
- Setting up core MCP integrations
- Building installation engine
- Implementing basic multi-agent coordination

## Key Files
- `.env.mcp`: MCP API keys and configuration
- `project-plan.md`: Comprehensive development roadmap
- `progress.md`: Real-time development tracking
- `diary.md`: Marketing-focused build journey

## Architecture Notes
- **Hybrid Installation**: Bash script + NPM package distribution
- **Node.js Runtime**: v18.0+ for core functionality
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux support
- **Intelligence Engine**: AI-powered MCP recommendations
