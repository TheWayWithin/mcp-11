## Migration Strategies

### Big Bang Migration
- **Approach**: Complete migration in single maintenance window
- **Pros**: Simple, fast cutover, no dual-system complexity
- **Cons**: Higher risk, longer downtime, harder to rollback
- **Best For**: Smaller systems, when downtime is acceptable

### Phased Migration
- **Approach**: Migrate in stages, component by component
- **Pros**: Lower risk, shorter downtime windows, easier testing
- **Cons**: More complex, longer overall timeline, dual maintenance
- **Best For**: Large systems, mission-critical applications

### Parallel Run
- **Approach**: Run both systems simultaneously during transition
- **Pros**: Zero downtime, extensive validation, easy rollback
- **Cons**: Resource intensive, complex synchronization
- **Best For**: High-availability requirements, critical systems

### Blue-Green Migration
- **Approach**: Switch traffic between identical environments
- **Pros**: Instant rollback, zero downtime, full testing
- **Cons**: Double infrastructure cost, complex setup
- **Best For**: Cloud-native applications, frequent migrations

## Risk Management

### Common Risks
- **Data Loss**: Incomplete migration, corruption during transfer
- **Extended Downtime**: Migration taking longer than planned
- **Performance Issues**: New system slower than expected
- **Application Compatibility**: Features not working post-migration

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Backups**: Full system backups before migration
- **Rollback Procedures**: Tested rollback plans and scripts
- **Validation Checks**: Automated data integrity validation
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing on target system

### Contingency Plans
- **Rollback Triggers**: Clear criteria for rollback decision
- **Communication Plan**: Stakeholder notification procedures
- **Extended Downtime**: Procedures for handling overruns
- **Data Recovery**: Recovery procedures for various failure scenarios

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Data Integrity**: 100% data accuracy and completeness
